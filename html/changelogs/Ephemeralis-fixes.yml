	tweak: "Malevolent spirits of the revenant variety have been weakened considerably by a recent ritual enacted by the High Chaplain. It has been heard that the ritual has given them awareness of their visibility to others, however."
	tweak: "Revenants have discovered a new way of drawing energies from mortal lifeforms, dramatically increasing the physical drain that such feats are capable of, much to the dismay of living creatures everywhere."
	tweak: "The Syndicate have improved their patented stamina toxin, opting to produce a new line of sleepy pen stealth units using it. The dossier reads that victims will find themselves tiring much more quickly than usual, falling unconscious rapidly if they decide to flee. Now 100% morphine free!"
	tweak: "Syndicate demolitions crews have stumbled upon an old minibomb mixture which forgoes the ability to gib corpses in exchange for dramatically improved station and hull damage. It should still prove lethal, but will no longer mince bodies that happen to be lying on top of it when it goes off."
	tweak: "HonkToys Co. reports that preliminary sales of the force foam dart guns to the Syndicate prove profitable, allowing them to increase the quality of the riot foam darts shipped with them. Rumor is that they they're fucking heavy now, ow."
	tweak: "The enigmatic reagent known only as 'Nothing' has been observed decaying into some unusual substances within non-mime subjects. Cool."
