changes: 
  - bugfix: "Mechs have now been equipped with a Super Capacity Cell, instead of a illegally modified Power Cell."
  - rscadd: "Replacing mech batteries now remembers the percentage of removed cells charge. In simple terms - replacing power cell does not recharge the mech, but it does keep the existing charge percentage."
