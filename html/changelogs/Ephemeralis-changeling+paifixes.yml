# Valid Prefixes: 
#   bugfix
#   wip (For works in progress)
#   tweak
#   soundadd
#   sounddel
#   rscadd (general adding of nice things)

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - tweak: "A series of Nanotrasen engineered pathogens have proven deadly against the hivemind creatures known as Changelings. To avoid outright destruction, the species has evolved a number of new traits to aid in their survival, at the expense of other things formerly taken for granted."
  - rscdel: "The mutations have removed the ability for Changelings to engorge their chemical glands."
  - rscdel: "The ability to swap minds with an unsuspecting target is no longer capable of being performed by a Changeling, destroyed utterly by the NT pathogen."
  - tweak: "The genomes responsible for the fleshmend adaptation have become much more obvious to onlookers in their struggle to stay alive, though the potency is unaffected."
  - rscdel: "The infamous cryosting mutation no longer exists."
  - rscadd: "A new genome has been distributed to the hive, allowing access to a powerful exhausting toxin that is capable of knocking out people who actively attempt to flee."
  - tweak: "The dissonant shriek adaptation now takes a significantly higher toll upon its bearer when used, in both chemical cost and the DNA fixtures it requires to obtain."
  - rscdel: "The armblade retrovirus sting has been abandoned, its complexity too much to maintain in the face of the NT pathogen."
  - tweak: "Absorbing aspects of the NT pathogen's nature has allowed Changelings to engineer an extremely virulent hallucinogenic disease, which they can distribute at will (and at significant cost to themselves) with the appropriate mutation."
  - rscadd: "Experienced virologists are able to discern the nature of this new hallucinogenic pathogen, and know that it can only originate from a few sources, all of them from xenomorphs."
  - rscdel: "The genome responsible for the single-victim hallucination sting no longer exists."
  - tweak: "The toxin responsible for muting potential victims now functions off a detectable chemical known as nulvocisine. The station CMO is educated enough to know that this toxin is not normally present."
  - bugfix: "Updates to pAI holographic emitter firmware have fixed a number of long standing irregularities in their interaction with the world. This has left them considerably more vulnerable than they were in the past."
  - tweak: "The strength of the pAI self-repair software has been improved, and the maximum damage it can cause to the unit reduced significantly."
  - tweak: "The holographic emitter overload software package now has the chance to deal potentially fatal levels of damage to a pAI's internal hardware. Use at your own risk."
