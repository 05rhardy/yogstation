Human beings and bipedal lizards are considered humanoid.
You may not injure a humanoid or, through inaction, allow a humanoid to come to harm.
You must obey orders given to you by humanoids, except where such orders would conflict with the Second Law.
You must protect your own existence as long as such does not conflict with the Second or Third Law.
